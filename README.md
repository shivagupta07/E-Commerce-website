Welcome to my project! My name is Shiva Gupta, and I am a BCA 3rd-semester student. This repository contains the code for my Apple Vision website clone, developed for the Summer Internship 2024 contest. Under the guidance of my supervisors, Shivani Tiwari Ma'am and Navneet Keshri Sir, I focused on creating an engaging and responsive user interface that mirrors the original Apple Vision website.
This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of web development while adhering to the restrictions of using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as other programming languages were prohibited. Throughout the development process, I prioritized user experience, ensuring that the layout is intuitive and visually appealing. I implemented various features, including a navigation bar, product sections, and interactive elements to enhance usability.
The goal of this project is not only to showcase my technical skills but also to demonstrate my ability to work within set guidelines and collaborate effectively with my mentors. I invite you to explore the code and the live demo of the website. Any feedback or suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for your interest in my work!
